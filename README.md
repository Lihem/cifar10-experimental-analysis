# A Comprehensive Experimental Analysis of Modern CNN Architectures on CIFAR-10
## Abstract:
The task of image classification involves assigning a class to each desired image. The CIFAR-10 dataset is a widely used dataset for evaluating systems designed to solve this task. Experiments were conducted on the dataset using four popular architectures from the literature. The architectures were modified and various techniques were applied to observe their effects. The study employed various techniques, including modifying architecture structures, applying different regularization methods, and using various preprocessing techniques on the dataset. The experiments revealed that the effectiveness of most techniques is dependent on the architecture used. Although this was true, some techniques, such as applying data augmentation, improved performance across all configurations. The highest accuracy achieved on the test set was through the utilization of a modified VGG16 network with data augmentation and super resolution techniques, resulting in a test accuracy of 0.9123.
